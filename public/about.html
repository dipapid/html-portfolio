<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello everyone, I'm Dipapid, a Computer Science student at La Sapienza
  University in Rome.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since I was a kid, I loved using computers and electronic devices. After
  working for 4 years at my parents' company, I decided to pursue a degree.
</p>
<p>
  I'm oriented towards backend programming, particularly with Python, but I'm
  also learning web development.
